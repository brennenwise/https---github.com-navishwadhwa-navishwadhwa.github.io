I am very excited to share this new piece from my postdoc research. We spun bacteria with ultrafast rotating electric fields to learn about how the flagellar motor unbuilds and rebuilds itself. Check out the preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.427295v1){:target="_blank"}.
