Our new preprint describes the structure and mechanism of sodium-driven stator units from the bacterium *Vibrio alginolyticus*. This work, led by Haidai Hu in Nicholas Taylor's lab, solves the puzzle of how stator units select for specific ions (e.g., sodium ions vs protons). Check out the preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.25.517900v1.full){:target="_blank"}.
