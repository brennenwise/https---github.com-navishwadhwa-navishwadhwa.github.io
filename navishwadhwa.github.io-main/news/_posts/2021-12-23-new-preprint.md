Excited to share our new work, conducted in collaboration with [Alberto Sassi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-sassi-452925160){:target="_blank"} and [Yuhai Tu](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-yuhai){:target="_blank"}, on the dynamics of mechano-adaptation in the bacterial flagellar motor. We performed a detailed statistical analysis of the single binding and unbinding events that enable the flagellar motor to adapt to changes in mechanical load by remodeling its stator. We propose a minimal model consisting of four stator unit states that quantitatively explains multiple features of the experimental data and allows us to determine the transition rates between all four states.
