**The Wadhwa lab** opened its doors in the [Department of Physics](https://physics.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution](https://biodesign.asu.edu/research/centers/mechanisms-evolution){:target="_blank"} at Arizona State University in August 2022! We study mechanical interactions between bacterial cells and their environment as well as the intracellular signaling processes that enable bacteria to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.

<span style="color:FireBrick;">**We are always happy to hear from motivated scientists (postdocs, graduate students, or undergraduates) interested in working with us. Visit the [Join](/join){:target="_blank"} page to get started.**</span>
