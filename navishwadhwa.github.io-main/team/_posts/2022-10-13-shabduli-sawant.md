I am a graduate student in the Biological Design PhD program. I apply biophysics and quantitative biology approaches to study how the bacterial flagellar motor acts as a mechanosensor. I am interested in understanding how molecular scale protein dynamics tune the bacteriumâ€™s response to environmental stimuli.
